            <h1 class="title">what are succulents?</h1>
            <div class="textContent">
                <p>&emsp;<span class="startLetter">In botany,</span> succulents are plants with parts that are
                    thickened, fleshy, and engorged,
                    usually to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. It is a characteristic that
                    is not used scientifically for the definition of most families and genera of plants because
                    often, it only can be used as an accurate characteristic at the single species level. The word
                    succulent comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning 'juice', or 'sap'. Succulent plants may store
                    water in various structures, such as leaves and stems. Some definitions also include roots, thus
                    geophytes that survive unfavorable periods by dying back to underground storage organs may be
                    regarded as succulents. In horticultural use, the term succulent is sometimes used in a way
                    that excludes plants that botanists would regard as succulents, such as cacti.
                    Succulents are often grown as ornamental plants because of their striking and unusual appearance,
                    as well as their ability to thrive with relatively minimal care. Many plant families have multiple
                    succulents species found within them. In following families most species are succulents:</p>

                <p>The habitats of these water-preserving plants are often in areas with high temperatures and low
                    rainfall, such as deserts. Succulents have the ability to thrive on limited water sources, such as
                    mist and dew, which makes them equipped to survive in an ecosystem that contains scarce water
                    sources.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;<span class="startLetter">By definition,</span> succulent plants are drought resistant plants
                    in which the leaves, stem or roots have become more than usually fleshy by the development of
                    water-storing tissue. Other sources exclude roots as in the definition "a plant with thick, fleshy
                    and swollen stems and/or leaves, adapted to dry environments". This difference affects the
                    relationship between succulents and "geophytes" – plants that survive unfavorable seasons as a
                    resting bud on an underground organ. These underground organs, such as bulbs, corms, and tubers, are
                    often fleshy with water-storing tissues. Thus if roots are included in the definition, many
                    geophytes would be classed as succulents. Plants adapted to living in dry environments such as
                    succulents, are called xerophytes. However, not all xerophytes are succulents, since there are other
                    ways of adapting to a shortage of water, e.g., by developing small leaves which may roll up or
                    having leathery rather than succulent leaves. Nor are all succulents xerophytes, since some plants
                    such as Crassula helmsii are both succulent and aquatic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;<span class="startLetter">In horticultural use,</span> the term succulent regularly excludes
                    cacti. However, in botanical<br> terminology, cacti are succulents, but not the reverse as many
                    succulent plants are<br> not cacti. Cacti bear true spines and appear only in the New World (the
                    Western<br> Hemisphere), and through parallel evolution similar looking plants evolved in<br>
                    completely different plant families in the Old World without spines, a distinct organ<br> structure.
                    Horticulturists often follow commercial conventions and may exclude<br> other groups of plants such
                    as bromeliads, that scientifically, are considered<br> succulents.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A further difficulty for general identification is that plant families (the genus) are<br> neither
                    succulent nor non-succulent and contain both. In many genera and<br> families there is a continuous
                    gradation from plants with thin leaves and normal<br> stems to those with very clearly thickened and
                    fleshy leaves or stems, so the<br> succulent characteristic becomes meaningless for dividing plants
                    into genera<br> and families. Different sources may classify the same species differently.

                <p>&emsp;<span class="startLetter">Succulents</span> are now seen in everything from boutonnieres to
                    hanging planters. They are a trend that is taking over not
                    just gardens, but wedding and home decor as well. Succulents are known for their low maintenance and
                    long lifespans,
                    which makes them great for people who work all day, are on the go or just aren’t great at taking
                    care of plants. These
                    plants are great for adding structure and vibrance to gardens and homes. There are many types of
                    succulents that can
                    be used as corner plants in a home office or pops of color in a lush garden. Here are some of the

                    Also known as the donkey tail plant, this succulent is
                    one of the easiest plants to propagate and care for,
                    which makes it a popular houseplant. The burro’s tail
                    was given its name because of its ability to grow up to
                    four inches long with a shape that resembles a tail. This succulent
                    grows best indoors, placed in a well-drained container,
                    where its long stems can drape down off of the edges

                    The flaming katy is a common
                    houseplant that is native to
                    Madagascar. It prefers temperatures
                    from 60 to 85 degrees, and is
                    extremely sensitive to the cold
                    which is why it is best suited for indoors.

                    The jade plant is similar to a bonsai plant in
                    the way that it grows and is maintained. It has
                    a thick trunk with branches that jut out like a
                    miniature tree.
                    Some varieties of the jade plant develop a red
                    color at the tip of the leaf. Once the plant matures
                    and if the conditions are right, the jade
                    plant can develop beautiful white or pink
                    flowers that bloom in the shape of a star.

                    houseplant that is most known
                    for its medical benefits. It has
                    been grown for many years
                    and cultivated for its medicinal
                    purposes. You can use the
                    healthy compounds of the aloe
                    vera plant to ease scrapes and
                    burns, so it is a great plant to

                    Native to West Africa, the snake plant is one of the
                    easiest succulents to cultivate. It can be neglected for long
                    periods of time and still maintain its fresh look. This plant
                    has long, variegated leaves in different shades of green. It
                    is one of the most tolerant types of indoor succulents
                    and can survive in rooms with low light and little water.

                    This cactus is a member of the prickly pear
                    family that grows evenly spaced clusters of
                    hairs rather than sharp spines. The
                    Mexican native grows clusters of pads
                    that get no larger than two feet tall but
                    can grow up to five feet across over time.
                    Pale yellow blooms are followed by red,

                    The zebra plant can grow between five
                    and six inches tall and wide. It does not
                    take up a lot of room and does not require
                    much care, so it works well as a houseplant.
                    The zebra plant gets its name from the white
                    variegated stripes on its leaves. These striking
                    leaves point out from its stem in different directions.
                    This plant has shallow roots and is best grown in
                    smaller pots. The zebra plant produces bright yellow, cone
                    shaped flower heads that last about a week. They are
                    dainty, slow-growing and have an eccentric appearance.

                        Succulents don’t like to sit in waterlogged soil, so drainage is important to prevent rot. Your
                        container should have a drainage hole to allow excess water to escape. Terra-cotta pots are

                        succulent. Newly planted succulents can scorch in direct sunlight, so you may need to gradually
                        introduce them to full sun exposure or provide shade with a sheer curtain. Succulents love
                        direct sun, but if yours is sitting in the same exact spot day after day, it's likely that only
                        one side is getting enough light. Succulents will lean towards the sun, so rotating them will
                        help them stand up straight. <br>
                        <span class="startLetter">3. Water according to the season and in the soil directly</span><br>
                        Just like us, succulents need more energy when they're in a period of growth. During the spring
                        and summer, the plants are thriving and drinking up much more water than when they're resting in
                        the fall and winter. When the top 1.25 inches are dry, grab your watering can. Overwatering can
                        kill your succulent, so make sure you let the soil dry between watering.
                        When you water your succulents, soak the soil until water runs out of the drainage holes. Don’t
                        use a spray bottle to water your succulents—misting can cause brittle roots and moldy leaves.
                        <br>
                        <span class="startLetter">4. Plant succulents in the right soil</span><br>
                        Succulents need soil that drains, so regular potting soil—or dirt from your yard—won’t do.
                        Choose cactus soil or mix potting soil with sand, pumice, or perlite. Succulent roots are very
                        fragile so be gentle when repotting. <br>
                        <span class="startLetter">5. Get Rid of Bugs</span><br>
                        Pests shouldn’t be a problem for indoor succulents, but occasionally you may have to deal with
                        bugs. Gnats are attracted to succulents that are planted in soil that is too wet and doesn’t
                        have proper drainage. To get rid of eggs and larvae, spray the soil with 70 percent isopropyl
                        alcohol. Mealybugs are another pest succulent owners have to deal with. Overwatering and
                        overfertilizing are the common causes of mealybugs. Move infected plants away from other
                        succulents and spray with 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. <br>

                        Nature to include regions of desert in South Africa and Namibia and a biodiversity hotspot. The
                        Succulent Karoo is notable for the world's richest flora of succulent plants, and harbours about
                        one-third of the world’s approximately 10,000 succulent species. 40% of its succulent plants are
                        endemic. It is literally a desert bursting with flowers.

                        A pitaya or pitahaya is the fruit of several different cactus species indigenous to the
                        Americas. Pitaya usually refers to fruit of the genus Stenocereus, while pitahaya or dragon
                        fruit refers to fruit of the genus Hylocereus, both in the family Cactaceae. Dragon fruit is
                        cultivated in Southeast Asia, in the United States, the Caribbean, Australia, Mesoamerica and
                        throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world.

                        Cacti vary in size and shape. The tallest free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a
                        maximum recorded height of 19.2 m, and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputana, only about 1 cm
                        in diameter at maturity. A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb
                        as much as 760 liters of water during a rainstorm.

                        Opuntias (prickly pears) were used for a variety of purposes by the Aztecs, whose empire,
                        lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital
                        from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the
                        name is that it includes the Nahuatl word nōchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The
                        coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image at the
                        center of the myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan.
