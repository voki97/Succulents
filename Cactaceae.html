                <p><span class="startLetter">Family Cactaceae</span> is a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order
                    Caryophyllales. The word "cactus" derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek kaktos, a name
                    originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is now not certain. Cacti occur in
                    a wide range of shapes and sizes. Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many
                    live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places
                    on Earth. Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. Almost all cacti are succulents, meaning
                    they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is
                    the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost
                    true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against
                    herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing
                    some shade. In the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Cacti are native to
                    the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the northâ€”except for
                    Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka. Cacti inhabit diverse regions, from
                    coastal plains to high mountain areas. A number of centers of diversity exist. For cacti adapted to
                    drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern
                    Andes, where they are found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern Brazil, away from the
                    Amazon Basin.

                <p>Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch. Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multipetaled. Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain, followed by long drought periods.
                  Many smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage, with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration. The tallest free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputiana.

                  <br><br>
                  It is not known when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used for a
                  variety of purposes by the Aztecs, from the 14th to the 16th century. Europeans first
                  encountered cacti when they arrived in the New World late in the 15th century. They used
                  it as purely ornamental species and some as edible fruit. Peeled fruits of the Indian fig
                  cactus of different varieties on sale in Mexico. The plant now known as Opuntia ficus-
                  -indica, or the Indian fig cactus, has long been an important source of food. Flower buds,
                  particularly of Cylindropuntia species, are also consumed.
                  <br>
                  Almost any fleshy cactus fruit is edible. The fruit of the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) can
                  be preserved by boiling to produce syrup and by drying. The syrup can also be fermented
                  to produce an alcoholic drink. Fruits of Stenocereus species have also been important
                  food sources in similar parts of North America; Stenocereus queretaroensis is cultivated
                  for its fruit. In more tropical southern areas, the climber Hylocereus undatus provides
                  dragon fruit. Other cacti providing edible fruit include species of Echinocereus, Ferocactus,
                  Mammillaria, Myrtillocactus, Pachycereus, Peniocereus and Selenicereus. The bodies of
                  cacti other than opuntias are less often eaten, although Anderson reported that
                  Neowerdermannia vorwerkii is prepared and eaten like potatoes in upland Bolivia.

                  Psychoactive agents
                  <br>
                  A number of species of cacti have been shown to contain psychoactive agents, such as
                  mescaline. They can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their
                  effects on the brain. Two species have a long history of use by the indigenous peoples of
                  the Americas: peyote, Lophophora williamsii, in North America, and the San Pedro cactus,
                  Echinopsis pachanoi, in South America.
